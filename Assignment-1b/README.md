In this assignment, you are asked to:

Extend the ray casting program that you wrote for assignment 1a to:
1. Allow the color at each rendered ray/surface intersection point to be defined using the Blinn-Phong illumination model with one or more directional and/or point light sources, rather than simply returning a constant default color for every ray/surface intersection point
2. Model the effect of cast shadows, by tracing a secondary ray from the ray/surface intersection point at which the shading is being computed towards the light source(s) and checking for potential intersections with intervening objects along the way

For complete details, please see this document:
