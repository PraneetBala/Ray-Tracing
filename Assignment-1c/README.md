In this assignment, you are asked to extend the raytracing program that you wrote for assignment 1b to: 
1. Render triangles as well as spheres
2. Support smooth shading of triangle meshes
3. Incorporate texture mapping of spheres and triangles.

You can extend your program to allow the specification of a parallel projection, in addition to the default perspective projection that it currently achieves.
