In this assignment, you are asked to extend the raycasting program that you wrote for assignment 1c to compute the color at a ray/surface intersection point using recursive ray tracing with an extended version of the Phong illumination equation that additionally considers:
1. Intensity that is specularly reflected to the ray/surface intersection point from other portions of the scene
2. Intensity from other parts of the scene that is transmitted through the intersected surface, when that surface is transparent.

You may extend your program to enable depth of field effects through the use of distributed ray tracing.
